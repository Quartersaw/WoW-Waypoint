# WoW-Waypoint

A World of Warcraft addon programmed in Lua.

Allows the user to place their own marker on the world map.  A guide arrow on the minimap will always point to this marker.

I created this addon to help me navigate across multiple zones in Kalimdor while working on Tol'vir archaeology. 

(This addon has not been updated to conform to changes in the game's map system.)
