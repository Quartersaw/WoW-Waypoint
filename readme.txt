Shoutouts: Esamynn for the Astrolabe library
           Schnoggo for the excellent SimpleCoords mod which served as a model for this one.

Description
===========
Waypoint allows you to set a navigational marker on the zone map.  A flashing arrow on the minimap will
then guide you to your target location.  Useful when flying between zones ( such as for Archeology ).

Operation
=========
Double-click the desired spot on the zone map to set your waypoint.
Double-click again to manually delete the waypoint marker.
Follow the flashing minimap arrow to your destination.  The waypoint marker will
automatically clear when you are near your marked spot.
